## 🚀 Key Features  
- **YOLOv8 Player Detection**: Uses **YOLOv8** to detect and track players in tennis match footage.  
- **Fine-Tuning for Ball Detection**: Enhances YOLO to accurately detect the **tennis ball** under different conditions.  
- **Speed Detection**: Computes the speed of both players and the ball for **performance evaluation**.  
- **Mini Court Generation**: Creates a **miniature version of the court**, reflecting real-time player positions and movements.  
- **Key Point Extraction**: Fine-tunes **ResNet50** to extract key court points for **spatial analysis and strategy insights**.

## ⚙️ Usage  
### ▶️ Running the System  
1. Place your **tennis match video** (\`.mp4\` format) inside the \`input_video/\` folder.  
2. Run the main script:  
   \`\`\`sh
   python main.py
   \`\`\`
3. The system will process the video, performing:  
   - Player detection  
   - Ball tracking  
   - Speed calculation  
   - Mini court visualization  
   - Key point extraction
